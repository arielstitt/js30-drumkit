## HOW DO LEARN

Things I learned while doing the 30 Day JS Challenge with Wes Bos. 

Including, things I already knew in explained in a different way.


### So How Do Event??

- An `event` is somthing that happens. 
- An `event listener` waits for an `event` to happen

Analogy Time: When I hear the macarena song(event listener), I do the macarena dance(event). 

Basic Syntax
``` 
element.addEventListener(event, function, useCapture);
```
You can add an event listener to any element in the DOM. 

### How Select Attribute?

What is an attribute? After looking online, there was a lot of gloobity glob and technical jargen. 

Attributes are like ajectives. A `tall`, `thin` man riding a `midnight black` horse on a `warm` and `dewy` morning. 

In this case, the elements are the nouns: man, horse, morning.

*** Makeshift code time: ***

`<img src="man" height="tall" width="thin">`

To select an attribute, lasso the element brackets `[]` with the name of the attribute(in quotes) inside.

`img["height"]`


### How Do Transistion End?


### Who `THIS`?!?

```
<div data-key="65" class="key playing">
      <kbd>A</kbd>
      <span class="sound">clap</span>
</div>
```
